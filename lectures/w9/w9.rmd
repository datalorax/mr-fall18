# Let's get setup

### Tonight, we'll work with multiple data sources
* elemapi.sav (re-download if you already have it)
* mtcars (but it's part of base R so don't worry)
* simdata


---
# elemapi

```{r load-elemapi}
elemapi <- import(here("data", "elemapi.sav"),
                  setclass = "tbl_df") %>%
  characterize()

head(elemapi)
```

---
# Multicollinearity
Are two (or more) variables proxies for the same thing?

--
```{r cor}
elemapi %>%
  select(api00, meals, ell, mobility, acs_k3, acs_46, emer, enroll) %>%
  cor(use = "complete.obs") %>%
  round(2)
```

---
# Cutoffs
* If we get above .7, we're probably getting pretty concerned. 

* Above .9, really concerned


--
* Why can't we just include them anyway?

Wait... none of these things significantly relate to miles per gallon?

# Variance inflation
* Notice what (multi)collinearity does to the standard errors


```{r standard-errors1}
arm::display(m, digits = 4)
```

---

```{r standard-errors2}
arm::display(hp_mod, digits = 4)
arm::display(cyl_mod, digits = 4)
```

---
```{r standard-errors3}
arm::display(disp_mod, digits = 4)
```

---
# High collinearity...

--
* Leads to larger standard errors


--
* Larger confidence intervals


--
* smaller $t$ values


--
### Overall this leads to

--
* More uncertainty of the estimated effects (why? We're not as sure what's
  contributing to the observed score)


--
* Less likelihood of detecting significant effects

---
# Why is this happening?

### Recall the standard error of the estimate
This is for the two predictor variable case
.Large[
$$
s\_{b\_{y1.2}} = \frac{s\_{y.x}}{\sqrt{\sum x\_1^2(1-r\_{x\_1x\_2}^2)}}
$$
]


* Look at the denominator here...


--
* You're multiplying the variance in $x_1$ by $1 -$ the correlation between the
  variables


---
# Collinearity
* If there is no correlation, the variance is unaltered, which means...


--
* The denominator ends up being larger, which means...


--
* The overall value will be smaller


--
* In other words, the standard error is smallest when the correlation with the
  other variables in the model is zero

---
# Let's confirm this
* Is this just a statistical nicety? 
* What if we  use the bootstrap method. Do we see the same thing?

--
Our model is unstable because the predictors are highly collinear

---
# Diagnosing collinearity
* Looking zero-order correlations can help... .bolder[but it's not enough!]


--
* Two well-respected diagnostic tools
  + Tolerance
  + Variance inflation factor

---
# Tolerance
* Tolerance = Variance in a predictor variable $i$ **not** accounted for by the
  other variables

--

From our example, let's calculate the tolerance of $hp$
--

```{r }
hp_tol_mod <- lm(hp ~ cyl + disp, mtcars)
1 - summary(hp_tol_mod)$r.squared
```

---
# Variance Inflation Factor

Even better (from my view)
* Essentially, how much has the variance of the estimate (the standard
  error) increased because of the collinearity?

--
* Ranges from $1 \dots \infty$

--
* Interpreted as the factor by which the variance is increased (e.g., a value
  of 5 means the variance is 5 times larger)

---
# VIF

.Large[
$$
VIF = \frac{1}{tol}
$$
]

--
VIF for hp

```{r vif-hp}
1 / (1 - summary(hp_tol_mod)$r.squared)
```

---
# Calculating VIF 

* You could fit all of the different models, but that's a lot of work. Instead,
we can use the `vif` function from the `car` package.

```{r car-vif}
car::vif(m)
```

--
### Want tolerance?

```{r car-tol}
 1 / car::vif(m)
```

---
# Decision rules of 👍

### Tolerance
* Ranges from 0-1
* Lower values = more concern/higher collinearity
* (generally less used; Pedhazur says they were first used because they were
	easier to compute)

--

### VIF
* Lower values are better (minimum of 1.0)
* Some use values of 3-5 as concerning, others 10
* Values of 10 or more are **definitely** concerning


---
# What to do?

* First, evaluate the impact of collinearity

	+ substantively changing results?


--
* Next, consider removing a predictor variable
	+ If they're mostly measuring the same thing, why bother with both?


--
* If removing is unsatisfactory, consider creating a composite variable
	+ mean
	+ PCA/EFA

# Modeling non-linearity

---
# Thinking about functional form
* What does "functional form" mean?


--
* Theoretically there exists some underlying, "true", population-level function
	relating a variable/set of variables to an outcome.


--
* The functional form = the form (shape) of this theoretical function


--
* Functional forms can be linear... or not. We need to evaluate and account for
	functional form appropriately.

---
# A bivariate example

### Linear?

```{r quad, fig.height = 4.75}
d <- import(here("data", "simdata.csv"),
            setclass = "tbl_df")
ggplot(d, aes(x, y)) +
	geom_point() +
	geom_smooth()
```

---
# How do we model this?

To model it linearly, we fit the model

.Large[
$$
y\_i = b\_0 + b\_1(x\_i) + e
$$
]

### In code


```{r eval = FALSE}
linear <- lm(y ~ 1 + x, data = d)
```

--

To model it with a curve, with one bend


.Large[
$$
y\_i = b\_0 + b\_1(x\_i) + b\_2(x\_i^2) + e
$$
]

---
# Two ways to model a quadratic

* First, create a variable that is the squared version of the variable

```{r squared-var}
d <- d %>%
	mutate(x2 = x^2)
d
```

---
# Include term in model

```{r quad1}
q1 <- lm(y ~ x + x2, d)
arm::display(q1, detail = TRUE)
```

---
# Visualize it

```{r q1-fitted-plot, fig.height = 4.5}
d <- d %>%
	mutate(fitted_q1 = fitted(q1)) 

ggplot(d, aes(x, y)) +
	geom_point() +
	geom_line(aes(y = fitted_q1),
	          color = "magenta", 
	          size = 2)
```

---
# Why is this working?

```{r squared-df1}
data_frame(x = 0:10,
           x2 = x^2,
           b1 = coef(q1)[2],
           b2 = coef(q1)[3])
```

---
```{r squared-df2}
data_frame(x = 0:10,
           x2 = x^2,
           b1 = coef(q1)[2],
           b2 = coef(q1)[3],
           y_hat = x*b1 + x2*b2)
```

---
# Method 2

```{r q2-fit}
q2 <- lm(y ~ poly(x, 2, raw = TRUE), d)
arm::display(q2, detail = TRUE)
```

--
```{r q1-display-again}
arm::display(q1, detail = TRUE)
```

---
* What's this `raw = TRUE` about? let's try without

--

```{r orthogonal}
q2o <- lm(y ~ poly(x, 2), d)
arm::display(q2o)
```
# 😳

--
* Without `raw = TRUE`, it will fit with orthogonal polynomials.
* This is actually probably a good thing, but I tend to not use it.

---
# Wait... what about collinearity

--

```{r collinear-q1}
car::vif(q1)
```
# 😳

--
```{r cor-squared}
cor(d$x, d$x2)
```

# 😬

---
# Look back at estimates

```{r q1-display}
arm::display(q1, digits = 4)
```

# 🤔

---
# How much do we care?

--
* In this case, probably not at all


--
* We will **never** interpret one variable in isolation (many people will try,
	don't fall into this trap)

* This is also partly why orthogonal polynomials may be preferable

---
# Want to fix it anyway?
### Center

```{r center-quadratic}
d <- d %>%
	mutate(xc = x - mean(x),
	       x2c = xc^2)
cor(d$xc, d$x2c)
```
(usually not quite that dramatic)


---
# Refit

```{r refit-centered-quadratic}
q1c <- lm(y ~ xc + x2c, d)
arm::display(q1c, detail = TRUE, digits = 4)
```

--
* So we've reduced the standard error, BUT... remember, we interpret these as a
	set of variables


--
* In more advanced models, centering helps stabilize the model overall

---
# Revisiting VIF

```{r vars}
vcov(q1)
vcov(q1c)
```

---
```{r vif-by-hand}
vcov(q1)[2, 2] /
vcov(q1c)[2, 2]
car::vif(q1)
```

---
# One more quick note

```{r se-increase1}
summary(q1)$coefficients[, "Std. Error"]["x"] 
summary(q1c)$coefficients[, "Std. Error"]["xc"]
```

--

```{r se-increase2}
summary(q1)$coefficients[, "Std. Error"]["x"] /
summary(q1c)$coefficients[, "Std. Error"]["xc"]
```

---
# SE increase
Rather than thinking about the variance increase, we can consider the SE
increase

.Large[
$\sqrt{VIF} =$ amount SE is increased
]

--

```{r se-increase3}
sqrt(car::vif(q1))
```

---
# Less clear in practice

```{r depression, fig.height = 6}
ggplot(elemapi, aes(mobility, api00)) +
	geom_point() +
	geom_smooth()

# Fit quadratic

q3 <- lm(api00 ~ poly(mobility, 2, raw = TRUE), elemapi)
arm::display(q3, detail = TRUE)
```

---
# Visualize it

elemapi <- elemapi %>%
	mutate(fitted_q3 = fitted(q3))

ggplot(elemapi, aes(mobility, api00)) +
	geom_point() +

	          color = "magenta",

# Conclusions

* (multi-)collinearity can inflate standard errors and result in unstable 
	models


--
* Centering can help (often a lot)


--
* Functional form is important to investigate
	+ Aside from meeting model assumptions, can often lead to new/different
		substantive conclusions.


--
* Many different approaches to modeling functional form 
	+ Polynomials common, can be extreme in their predictions in the tails
	+ Transformation (log, log10, exponentiation, etc.) perhaps less common, but
		very useful

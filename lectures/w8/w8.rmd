# Let's get setup

### Tonight, we'll work with multiple data sources
* benchmarks.xlsx
* diagnostics.sav
* glo_sim.sav

---
# Revisiting $ssr$

--
### First, let's fit a model

```{r hsb}
benchmarks <- import(here("data", "benchmarks.xlsx"),
              setclass = "tbl_df") 

m1 <- lm(rdg_spr ~ rdg_fall, benchmarks)
arm::display(m1, detail = TRUE)
```

--
### Pop Quiz
What would the squared semipartial correlation for `rdg_fall` be here?

---
# It's $R^2$!
(which is actually $r^2$ in this case)

--
```{r lmSupport}
library(lmSupport)
modelEffectSizes(m1)
```

---
# Multi-model comparison
* Let's think about the previous example from a multi-model comparison
perspective.

--
* We want to compare how much **additional** variance is accounted for by the
model with the inclusion of `rdg_fall`. 

--
* What does that mean?

--
* Compare the difference between a model with no predictors

--
* What does it mean for a model to have no independent variables? What would we
be estimating?

--
.Large[
$$
rdg\_{spr} = b\_0 + e
$$
]

---

```{r m0_fit}
m0 <- lm(rdg_spr ~ 1, benchmarks)
arm::display(m0, detail = TRUE, digits = 4)
```

--
What does the intercept represent here?


--
The grand mean for the outcome.

```{r mean}
mean(benchmarks$rdg_spr)
```

---
# Pop Quiz
What would the fitted values (predictions from the model for our observed 
cases) be for this model be?

--
```{r fitted}
benchmarks %>%
  mutate(m0_fitted = fitted(m0))
```

---
# Why do we care?
* We can use it as a basis of comparison.

Let's look back at our output from `m1`

---
```{r m1-display, highlight.output = 18}
summary(m1)
```

---
# Comparing models
We can use the `anova` function to compare models

```{r m0-m1-compare, highlight.output = 7}
anova(m0, m1)
```

--
Notice that the $F$ test is exactly the same!

---
# Okay so... who cares?

.center[

]

--
* We can get a direct test of significance for squared semi-partial correlations

--
* We can test if **blocks** of variables significantly reduce the residual
variance 

--
* We can directly compare parallel slopes models with non-parallel slopes 
  models (i.e., interactions)

---
## Let's think about a slightly more complicated model

```{r }
m2 <- lm(rdg_spr ~ rdg_fall + sped, benchmarks)
arm::display(m2)
```

---
# Look at the difference in $R^2$

```{r r2-diff}
summary(m1)$r.squared
summary(m2)$r.squared
```

--
### What's the unique variance accounted for by `sped`?

```{r sped-ssr}
summary(m2)$r.squared - summary(m1)$r.squared
```

--
Is this value different than zero?

---
# Compare models

```{r m1-m2-compare}
anova(m1, m2)
```


--
### Challenge
* Can you calculate (any method you want) and test the significance of
$\Delta R^2$ for `rdg_fall`?

---

```{r sped-mod}
sped_mod <- lm(rdg_spr ~ sped, benchmarks)
summary(m2)$r.squared - summary(sped_mod)$r.squared
modelEffectSizes(m2)
```

---
```{r sped-mod-m2-compare}
anova(m2, sped_mod)
```

---
# How important is this?
In many ways, this is just a different test of the coefficient (using an $F$
test versus a $t$ test)

--

```{r scipen-off, echo = FALSE}
options(scipen = 999)
```

```{r compare-pvals}
anova(m2, sped_mod)$`Pr(>F)`[2]
summary(m2)$coefficients["rdg_fall", "Pr(>|t|)"]
```

```{r scipen-on, echo = FALSE}
options(scipen = 2)
```

--
So we're getting the exact same probability estimate, just using different
criteria and different tests.

# A brief foray into information criteria


---
# Comparing models
* Often we may have a set of models we are comparing, and we want to know
  which is "best".
  + Side note "best" can depend on context


--
### Three guiding principles
1. Simplicity and parsimony: "Shave away all but what is necessary"
2. Multiple working hypotheses
  + Rather than a null hypothesis, consider comparing competing theories
3. Strength of Evidence

---
# Akaike Information Criteria

* Rather complicated, and rather useful

--

.Large[

$$
AIC = -2 \times log(L(\hat{\theta}|data)) + 2 \times K
$$

]

--
Luckily, R provides a handy-dandy function to calculate it for you.

```{r aic}
AIC(m0)
AIC(m1)
AIC(m2)
```

---
# What do these values mean?


* Wholly uninterpretable on their own 


--
* Difference between the values are interpretable and can be useful when
  comparing competing models 
    + perhaps representing different theories

--
* Lower AIC values = better fit to the model

--
* The $2 \times K$ part represents a penalization for model complexity

  + As you add variables to model, this value will increase, and so will AIC,
    unless there is a corresponding reduction in, essentially, residual 
    variance


---
# Guidelines $\Delta AIC$ interpretation

Recommendations by Burnham and Anderson (2002)

.gray[That Anderson is not me, obvi]


--
First, rescale the AIC values such that the lowest AIC value is zero

.gray[Note, we're basically centering here]

.Large[
$$
\Delta\_i = AIC\_i - AIC\_{min}
$$
]



1. $\Delta_i \leq 2$: "Substantial support" (i.e., not much difference in
   the models)
2. $4 \leq \Delta_i \leq 7$: "Considerably less support" (i.e., gray zone)
3. $\Delta_i \gt 10$: "Essentially no support" (i.e., reject this model in 
   favor of the model where $\Delta_i = 0$)


---
# AIC weights

.Large[
$$
w\_i = \frac{exp(-\Delta\_i/2)}{\sum exp(-\Delta\_i/2)}
$$
]

--
What do these end up looking like? Proportions!


--
From Burnham and Anderson
> interpreted as the probability that model i is, in fact, the K-L best model for the data

Where K-L is the Kullback-Leibler information


---
# Evaluating our candidate models
```{r m012-compare}
anova(m0, m1, m2)
```

---
# Calculate $\Delta AIC$ values

### Compare model 0 and 1
```{r m01-aic-compare}
AIC(m1) - AIC(m0)
```

--
### Compare model 1 and 2
```{r m12-aic-compare}
AIC(m2) - AIC(m1)
```

# Weights calculation

# Blocks of predictors

---
# Load the diagnostics data
```{r diag}
diag <- import(here("data", "diagnostics.sav"),
               setclass = "tbl_df") %>% 
  characterize()

head(diag)
```


---
# Enter predictors in blocks
Predict youngest child weight
* Couple of ways we could think about entering the data in blocks.
  + By respondent (i.e., do mother responses contribute beyond father what 
    father responses contribute?)
  + By variable (e.g., "family" weight, height, etc.)
  

--
Let's enter by block for respondent, using weight, height, and age as 
predictors

---
# Competing theories
This is totally made up, but let's pretend there are different camps of people
who think:

--
1. Father's weight matters most for predicting a child's weight 

--
1. Mother's weight matters most for predicting a child's weight 

--
1. Parents contribute jointly in the prediction of a child's weight 

--
1. The weight of all family members contribute jointly in the prediction of a
   child's weight


--
### We can compare these competing theories!

---
# Control block

First, let's control for the age/height of the individual child, so we can see
how much family characteristics contribute beyond the individual's
characteristics.

```{r block-predictor1, highlight.output = 8}
yc_mod <- lm(ycweight ~ ycage + ycheight, diag)
arm::display(yc_mod, detail = TRUE)
```

---
# Father Only Block 

```{r block-predictor2, highlight.output = 12}
father_mod <- lm(ycweight ~ ycage + ycheight + 
                            fage + fheight + fweight,
                 data = diag)
arm::display(father_mod, detail = TRUE)
```

---
# Alternative syntax

```{r father-mod-update}
father_mod <- update(yc_mod, ~ . + fage + fheight + fweight)
```

---
# Mother Only Block
```{r block-predictor3, highlight.output = 12}
mother_mod <- lm(ycweight ~ ycage + ycheight + 
                            mage + mheight + mweight,
                 data = diag)
arm::display(mother_mod, detail = TRUE)
```


---
### Compare
```{r compare-father-mother}
anova(father_mod, yc_mod)
anova(mother_mod, yc_mod)
```


---
```{r compare-father-mother-aic}
sundry::aic_weights(father_mod, mother_mod, yc_mod)
```

---
# Parent Block
```{r block-predictor4, highlight.output = 15}
parent_mod <- lm(ycweight ~ ycage + ycheight + 
                            fage  + fheight  + fweight +
                            mage  + mheight  + mweight, 
                 data = diag)
arm::display(parent_mod, detail = TRUE)
```

---
# Compare
```{r compare-parent}
anova(yc_mod, parent_mod)
```

---
```{r compare-parent-aic}
sundry::aic_weights(yc_mod, father_mod, mother_mod, parent_mod)
```


---
# Family Block 
```{r block-predictor5}
family_mod <- lm(ycweight ~ ycage + ycheight +
                            fage  + fheight  + fweight +
                            mage  + mheight  + mweight +
                            ocage + ocheight + ocweight, 
                 data = diag)
```

---
```{r family-block-display, highlight.output = 18}
arm::display(family_mod, detail = TRUE)
```

---
# Compare
```{r compare-family}
anova(yc_mod, family_mod)
```

---
```{r compare-family-aic}
sundry::aic_weights(yc_mod, father_mod, mother_mod, 
                    parent_mod, family_mod)
```

---
# What to do from here?
* Remember, we're not talking about this from an exploratory lens, but rather, 
  competing theories. 


--
* The Akaike weights provide us with our primary finding here, which is somewhat
  inconclusive, although most of the evidence points to the model including 
  mother information with the youngest child being the best fit


--
* What if this process led to other ideas for competing models?


 
--
We could fit them, but it would be **Highly** exploratory. Generally, the 
models you fit **should be defined a priori**. Otherwise 🎣

# Interactions

---
## Let's fit the ELL interaction model again
Last class we fit the model

$$
Rdg\_{spr\_i} = b\_0 + b\_1(Rdg\_{fall\_i}) + b\_2(ELL\_i) + b\_3(ELL \times Rdg\_{fall\_i})  + e
$$

--
First, center `rdg_fall` so the intercept(s) make sense

```{r prep}
benchmarks <- benchmarks %>%
  mutate(rdg_fall_c = rdg_fall - mean(rdg_fall))
```


---
# Let's look back at the plot for this model

```{r ell-plot, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(benchmarks, aes(rdg_fall, rdg_spr)) +
  geom_point(color = "gray70") +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = ell),
              method = "lm")
```

---
# Fit the model

```{r ell-interaction}
ell_int <- lm(rdg_spr ~ rdg_fall_c + ell + rdg_fall_c:ell, benchmarks)
arm::display(ell_int, detail = TRUE, digits = 3)
```

--
### How would you evaluate if the interaction was "worth it"?

---
# Compare to a parallel slopes models

--
### Fit parallel slopes model
```{r ell-parallel}
ell_parallel <- lm(rdg_spr ~ rdg_fall_c + ell, benchmarks)
arm::display(ell_parallel, detail = TRUE)
```

--
Before we actually compare, what's your guess? Which model will display the
better statistical fit?

---
```{r ell-compare}
anova(ell_parallel, ell_int)
```

--
```{r ell-weights}
sundry::aic_weights(ell_parallel, ell_int)
```

---
# Another example

```{r }
glo <- import(here("data", "glo_sim.sav"),
              setclass = "tbl_df") %>%
  characterize()

head(glo)
```


---
# Block 1: Control variables

```{r glo-control}
glo_m1 <- lm(sex_risk ~ age + 
                        parent_education + parent_income + 
                        parent_eth + parent_race + 
                        teen_eth + teen_race,
             data = glo)
```

--
### If you want to see the coefficients, you'll need to fit the model yourself

---
# Block 2: Main effects

```{r glo-main-effects}
glo_m2 <- lm(sex_risk ~ internalizing + externalizing + aces +
                        age + 
                        parent_education + parent_income + 
                        parent_eth + parent_race + 
                        teen_eth + teen_race,
             data = glo)
```

---
# Block 3: Interactions

```{r glo-interactions}
glo_m3 <- lm(sex_risk ~ internalizing + externalizing + aces +
                        internalizing:aces + externalizing:aces +
                        age + 
                        parent_education + parent_income + 
                        parent_eth + parent_race + 
                        teen_eth + teen_race,
             data = glo)
```

---
# Compare models

.gray[In reality we'd have probably looked at the coefficients by now too]

```{r compare-glo12}
anova(glo_m1, glo_m2)
```

---
```{r compare-aic-glo12}
sundry::aic_weights(glo_m1, glo_m2)
```

---
# Compare to interaction model

```{r compare-glo23}
anova(glo_m2, glo_m3)
```

---
```{r compare-aic-glo23}
sundry::aic_weights(glo_m1, glo_m2, glo_m3)

```

---
# A note on over-fitting
* In this case, we have a whole lot of parameters 
  ($k = $`r length(glo_m3$coefficients)`), particularly for only `r nrow(glo)`
  cases.
* Our model is likely overfit. Entering variables in blocks does not prevent
  overfitting.

---
# Take home messages
* Fitting multiple models can be a powerful method for testing
competing/alternative theories

--
* Comparing competing models can be an efficient way to evaluate interactions
  + Particularly true for categorical variables (i.e., what to do if one of the
  interaction term is significant and another is not)

--
* Information criteria can help aid model comparisons, and actually have
stronger theoretical foundations than $p$ values.

---
# Next week
* We'll talk about predictive modeling
* Themes of information criteria will carry-forward
* We'll finally meet/discuss the infamous "adjusted" $R^2$

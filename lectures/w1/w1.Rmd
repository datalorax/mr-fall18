> "The bad news is that whenever you learn a new skill you're going to suck.
It's going to be frustrating. The good news is that is typical and happens to
everyone and it is only temporary. You can't go from knowing nothing to
becoming an expert without going through a period of great frustration and
great suckiness."

.major-emph-green[Welcome to R]

---
# What is R?
* A programming language
* Tremendously powerful and flexible statistical software that happens to be free
* No point-and-click interface
* Incredible array of external "packages" available for specialized analyses, data visualizations, or to automate much of the data "munging" process

---
# Code-based interface

![rstudio](../img/rstudio.png)

---
# Moving to code/programming

--

.pull-left[
### Advantages
* Flexibility
  + Essentially anything is possible
* Transparency
  + Documented history of your analysis
* Efficiency
  + Many (most?) tasks can be automated
]

--

.pull-right[
### Disadvantages
* Steep learning curve
  + Absolutely requires a significant time investment
  + Equivalent to learning a new language
* You will lose patience with point-and-click interfaces
* Likely to become "one of the converted"
]

---
# The R Learning Curve

.gray[(as seen by me)]

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 6.5, fig.width = 12}
curve(x^3, from = -50, to = 50, lty = 3, col = "cadetblue3", lwd = 3,
  axes = FALSE, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Learning", 
  main = "Steepness of the line roughly corresponds to your required effort")
axis(1, at = seq(-50, 50, 10),  labels = seq(0, 100, 10))
axis(2, at = seq(-1e5, 1e5, 2e4),  labels = seq(0, 101, 10))
```

---
# How to learn R?
* Three most important ingredients: time, time, and more time
* A sprinkling of dedication and determination help.
* Be patient and forgiving with yourself. It will feel slow at first. Most people have not trained themselves to think in this way.

# R as a big calculator

```{r calc_add}
3 + 2
```

```{r calc_eq}
(1/-(3/2)^2) / 2^-1/9
```

# Object Assignment
 
.pull-left[

### Assignment
```{r ob_assign1}
a <- 3
b <- 2
a + b
a / (a + b)
```

]

--

.pull-right[
### Re-assignment

```{r ob_assign2}
a <- 3
a
a <- 7
a
```

]

---
# Object Assignment (continued)

.pull-left[
Objects can be of a variety of types.

```{r ob_types}
string <- "Hello world!"
logical <- TRUE
double <- 3.2587021
Integer <- 6L
```
]

.pull-right[
In this case, we can't exactly do arithmetic with all of these. 
  For example

```{r, error = TRUE}
string + double
```
But, these objects can be extremely useful in programming.

# Functions and getting help

.pull-left[
### R functions
* Anything that carries out an operation in R is a function, even `+`. 
* Functions (outside of primitive functions) are preceded by `()`
    + e.g., `sum()`, `lm()`
]

.pull-right[
### Getting help
* `?` can be helpful, but often too advanced early on
    + Helpful for understanding the formal arguments of a function
    + Scroll down to the examples first
* Google is your  best friend
* Other resources discussed previously
* Your classmates!
* Me!
]    

---
# Data frames

* Equivalent of a spreadsheet (basically)
  + I prefer tibbles, you probably will too
* Access columns with `$`

---
# mtcars
* Already in R when you launch

```{r mtcars1}
head(mtcars)
mtcars$cyl
```

---
# Refer to df each time

```{r mtcars2, error = TRUE}
mtcars$cyl + mtcars$hp
mtcars$cyl + hp
```

---
# Let's try

[quick intro to R demo]

* Open R, and run the following
* Be careful about case - must match perfectly

```{r mtcars3, eval = FALSE}
mtcars
View(mtcars)
```

* Use `sum` to sum `hp`
* Use `mean` to calculate the mean of `mpg`

---
# Orientation of this course w/R
* This course will generally be oriented around the *tidyverse*. 
    + Very conscious decision that I really believe is the correct one.
    + The *tidyverse* is an alternative to base R functions
* What we've been doing are part of base R
* In tidyverse, you usually won't need `$`
  + Will be helpful today

# The mean

Notation of Pedhazur:

.Large[
$$
\bar{X} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^nX_i}{n}
$$
]

--
Thinking about this through R code. Mean of mpg "by hand".

```{r mean1}
sum(mtcars$mpg) / length(mtcars$mpg)
```

--
Does this match the mean R reports?

```{r mean2}
mean(mtcars$mpg)
```

---
# Quick aside
### Make it a function
* Copy and paste the code from before
* Swap out the specific variable for an argument `x`, that could be any variable

```{r fun1}
my_mean <- function(x) {
  sum(x) / length(x)
}
```

--

### test it out

.pull-left[

```{r funtest1}
my_mean(mtcars$cyl)
my_mean(mtcars$disp)
```

.pull-right[

```{r funtest2}
mean(mtcars$cyl)
mean(mtcars$disp)
```

# Deviation scores
Difference between a score and the mean of the vector. (don't worry too much
about the code yet)

```{r deviation}
mtcars$mean_mpg <- mean(mtcars$mpg)
mtcars$deviation <- mtcars$mpg - mtcars$mean_mpg

mtcars[c("mpg", "mean_mpg", "deviation")]
```

---
# Variability
* Deviation scores are the essence of variability
* We'd like to summarize the variability through the deviation scores. What
should we do?

--
### Try calculating the mean

```{r mean_dev}
round(mean(mtcars$deviation), 10)
```

# Variance

Sum of the **squared** deviations divided by `n - 1`.

.Large[
$$
s_x^2 = \frac{\sum_i^{n}(X_i-\overline{X})^{2}}{n-1}
$$
]

* Note we use `n - 1` and not `n` to correct for sampling variability. (makes
it an unbiased estimate)
* Another (more common) symbol for the variance is $\sigma^2$

---
# Standard deviation

.Large[
$$
s_x = \sqrt{s^{2}}
$$
]

The standard deviation is then just the square root of the variance! So, the
standard deviation is, essentially, the average of the deviations.

* Another (more common) symbol for the standard deviation is $\sigma$

# Let's try! 

### Together, we will:
* Calculate the variance of `mpg` from `mtcars` "by hand" 
* Transform it to a standard deviation
* Evaluate if the estimate matches the result from `var(mtcars$mpg)`

[demo]

### On your own:
* Calculate the variance and standard deviation of `mtcars$displ` "by hand"
* Super extra bonus kudos if you can turn it into a function

# Regression

---
# Plot it first
* Let's go back to our ggplot example
* add `+ geom_smooth()`. What do you see? .gray[(hint: This is not linear
regression)]
* Now change to `+ geom_smooth(method = "lm")`. What changed? Can you guess
  what `lm` stands for?
* Try one more time, with `+ geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)`. What has
  canged now?

---
# Regression vs. Correlation
* Regression is scale dependent
* Coefficient represents the expected (on average) change in $y$ given a
  one-unit increase in $x$.
* Standardized coefficient in simple linear regression = correlation 
  coefficient.

---
# The regression model from before

```{r wt-mpg-scatter, fig.width = 13, fig.height = 6}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

---
# Take a guess
* What sign will the regression coefficient have (positive/negative)?
* What do you think the coefficient will be?
  + What is the average change in $y$ for a one unit increase in $x$ (i.e., the
  regression line)?

---
# Let's fit the model!

* `lm` function stands for linear model.

--

```{r first-reg}
m <- lm(formula = mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
```

* Run the above and nothing happens. 🤨

--

* Have to print `m`, the object you stored the model in.

```{r print-reg-mod}
m
```

--
* Doesn't show us much. How do we get more?

---
# Evaluating output
* Use the `summary` function to see more of the model results

```{r summary-reg-mod}
summary(m)
```

---
# Slightly nicer output

```{r arm-reg-mod, message = FALSE}
library(arm)
display(m, detail = TRUE)
```

--

* What does all this mean?

--
* Remember the regression equation is

$$
Y_i = a + bX_i + e
$$

--

* In this case (for the fixed part), we're saying

$$
mpg = 37.29 + -5.34*wt
$$


---

.Large[
$$
mpg = 37.29 + -5.34*wt
$$
]

* What does 37.29 represent?
* What about -5.34?

--
* This is our prediction for any one car.
* The amount this is off, overall, is our residual variance.
* the `predict` function will do this for us automatically (and is extremely
  useful)

--
* Using the regression equation above, what `mpg` would we expect for a car 
  with a weight of 2.62?

---
# Quickly
* The `predict` function will use the model you feed it to predict new
observations.
* By default, the observations that were used to estimate the model

```{r preds}
mtcars$predictions <- predict(m)
head(mtcars)
```

---
# Other components

* $R^2$ = proportion of the variability captured by the model
  + regression sum of squares divided by the total variance
* Residual standard error = the standard deviation of the errors around the
regression line (assuming they are normally distributed)
  + regression sums of squares divided by the residual sum of squares

---
# Breaking the model down
* If we know nothing else, our best guess for any individual observation would
be the mean
* The deviations from the mean are large. This is our residual variance.


```{r plot-mean2, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 13}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = 1, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(mtcars$mpg), 
             color = "cornflowerblue",
             size = 1.2)
```


---
# Add a predictor
* When we add a predictor variable, we can then fit a regression line.
* Deviations from the line are now smaller (i.e., the variance has been 
  reduced).
* The amount (proportion) the variance has been reduced, is $R^2$


```{r plot-pred2, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 13}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```



---
# In equation form
* Residual variance is reduced with a regression line
* Proportion Variance reduction = $R^2$.
* First estimate how much is learned **because of the regression model**
  + $Y' - \overline{Y}$
    + $\sum(Y' - \overline{Y}) = 0$
  + $ss_{reg} = \sum (Y' - \overline{Y})^2$

--
* Next estimate how much of the variance is "left over"
  + Residual variance = $Y - Y'$
    + $ss_{res} = \sum (Y - Y')^2$

--

* Finally, estimate the total variance
  + $\sum y^2 = ss_{reg} + ss_{res}$

--

.large[
$R^2 = \frac{\sum (Y' - \overline{Y})^2}{(\sum (Y' - \overline{Y})^2) + (\sum (Y - Y'))} = \frac{ss_{reg}}{\sum y^2}$

# Decomposition
* Any individual observation is then composed of three components
  + Mean of $Y$
  + Difference between the regression equation and the mean of $Y$
  + Difference between the regression equation and the individual point

$$
Y = \overline{Y} + (Y' - \overline{Y}) + (Y - Y')

### Decomposition for Mazda RX4
```{r decomposition}
mtcars[1, ]
mean(mtcars$mpg)
```

--
$$
Y = \overline{Y} + (Y' - \overline{Y}) + (Y - Y')
$$

--
$$
21 = 20.09 + (23.28 - 20.09) + (21 -23.28)

# Residual standard error

.Large[
$$
e = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (Y - Y')^2}{df}} =  \sqrt{\frac{ss_{res}}{df}}
$$

]

* This equation, like all of statistics, tries to estimate the population-level
  residual variance
* $df = n - k$
* We can approximate it (i.e., calculate it for our sample) by calculating the
  standard deviation of our residuals

head(mtcars)
```

# Let's do it!

```{r partitioning}
predictions <- predict(m)

reg <- predictions - mean(mtcars$mpg)
ss_reg <- sum(reg^2)

res <- mtcars$mpg - predictions
ss_res <- sum(res^2)

r2 <- ss_reg / (ss_reg + ss_res)
e <- sqrt(ss_res/30)
```
### Run the following
* Go line by line
* Try to understand what each line does
* Does it match your output? from `summary(m)`

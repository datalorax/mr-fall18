# Let's start out with some R

---
# Demo
### Do it with me
* Create a new project
  + Place the Rmd file posted to canvas in the directory
* Add a data folder
  + Place the `elemapi.sav` data there
* Import the data into R
  + Use the `here` library
* Explore it a bit

# Some resources
The *ggplot2* package is one of the most popular R packages. There are a plethora of resources to learn the syntax. 

* Perhaps the most definitive, and indexes all the capabilities of ggplot2, along with multiple examples 
  + http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/index.html#

* RStudio cheat sheet can also be helpful
  + https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf

* R Graphics Cookbook
  + http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/

---
# Components
Every *ggplot* plot has three components

1. data
  * The data used to produce the plot
2. aesthetic mappings
  * between variables and visual properties
3. layer(s)
  * usually through the `geom_*` function to produce geometric shape to be
  rendered

---
# Basic syntax
![ggplotBasicSyntax](../img/ggplotBasicSyntax.png)

---
# Quick demo
* Couple different geoms
* Understand common mistakes 
  + And that it will take some trial & error

If you want, see my other slides [here](http://www.datalorax.com/vita/ds/ds1-slides/w2p1/) and [here](http://www.datalorax.com/vita/ds/ds1-slides/w2p2/)

# The data

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Load the libraries
library(rio)
library(here)
library(tidyverse)

# Set the ggplot theme
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 25))

# load the data
d <- import(here("data", "elemapi.sav"),
            setclass = "tbl_df")
```

# Research Question

> To what extent does the proportion of students eligible for free or reduced 
  price lunch at the school predict its overall API rating in the year 2000?


--
* What's the IV? DV?

--
### The model
$$
Y_i = a + bX_i + e
$$

--
### In this case...
$$
api00\_i = a + b(meals\_i) + e
$$

--
We fit the model to estimate $a$ and $b$.

---
# Fitting the model in R

```{r model1}
m1 <- lm(api00 ~ meals, d)
summary(m1)
```

---
# Coefficients
* $a$ = `r round(coef(m1)[1], 2)`
* $b$ = `r round(coef(m1)[2], 2)`

--
### What do these mean?

--
### Anybody remember how we estimate them?

--
What about $R^2$

---
# beta
`covariance(x, y) / variance(x)`

--
.Large[
$$
b = \frac{s\_{xy}}{s\_{xx}}
$$
]

--

```{r beta}
covariance <- cov(d$api00, d$meals, 
                  use = "complete.obs") 
variance <- var(d$meals, na.rm = TRUE)

beta <- covariance / variance
beta
```


---
# Intercept

`mean(y) - beta*(mean(x))`

--
.Large[
$$
a = \overline{y} - b\overline{x}
$$
]

--

```{r intercept1}
mean(d$api00, na.rm = TRUE) - beta*mean(d$meals, na.rm = TRUE)
```

--

.Large[.Large[🤨]]

Our intercept was estimated at `r round(coef(m1)[1], 2)`. 

What's going on here?


---
# Remove pairwise missing data

```{r intercept2}
pairwise <- d %>% 
  select(api00, meals) %>% 
  na.omit()
head(pairwise)

mean(pairwise$api00) - beta*mean(pairwise$meals)
```

---
# Your turn
* Use ggplot to show the relation between `ell` and `api00`
  + Overlay a **linear** relation
* Fit the corresponding model
* In small groups
  + Discuss what $a$ means
    + Is this a meaningful value?
  + Discuss what $b$ means

### If you have extra time
* Try calculating the intercept/slope "by hand"

$$
Y\_i = b\_0 + b\_1(X\_{1i}) + b\_2(X\_{2i}) + ... + b\_k(X\_{ki}) + e

* What does the intercept represent now?

--

* What does $b_1$ represent?

--
* What about $b_2$?

### Answer: Not at all

# What else does this imply?
* Unless $r_{x_1x_2} = 0$, $R^2 \neq  r^2_{x1} + r^2_{x2}$

# Let's fit a model
### Research Question

> To what extent do school API ratings in in the year 2000 relate to the
proportion of students receiving English language services **after controlling
for the proportion of students in the school receiving free or reduced price
lunch**?


--
### The model
$$
Y_i = b\_0 + b\_1meals\_i + b\_2ell\_i + e
$$

---
# Fitting the model

```{r m2}
m2 <- lm(api00 ~ meals + ell, d)
summary(m2)
```

---
# Let's interpret

```{r m2-display}
library(arm)
display(m2, detail = TRUE)
```

* What does the intercept mean, in words?
* What about each of the coefficients?
* Using this model, what API score would you predict for a school with 50% of
  students eligible for free or reduced price lunch, and 10% of students
  receiving ELL services?

---
# Prediction

"By hand" 

$Y' = 853.61 + -3.01*50 + -1.08*10$

$Y' = `r 853.61 + -3.01*50 + -1.08*10`$

--

With code

```{r pred1}
pred_frame = tibble(meals = 50,
                    ell = 10)

predict(m2, newdata = pred_frame)
```

---
# Make a range of predictions

```{r pred_frame2}
pred_frame2 <- tibble(meals = seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 10),
                      ell = 10)
pred_frame2
```

---
# Predict for each case

* If we just use `predict`, it will return a *vector*

--

* .Large[🤔] What's a vector again?

--

```{r pred-pre_frame2}
predict(m2, newdata = pred_frame2)
```

---
* Probably easier to see by adding it as a new variable

```{r pred_frame2-add-var}
pred_frame2$pred <- predict(m2, newdata = pred_frame2)

head(pred_frame2)
```

---
# Quick aside

* The {tidyverse} version would be to use `mutate`

```{r mutate}
library(tidyverse)

pred_frame2 <- pred_frame2 %>%
  mutate(pred = predict(m2, newdata = pred_frame2))

head(pred_frame2)
```

--

* Look at the difference in `pred` for each row... what do you notice?

---

```{r lag}
pred_frame2 %>%
  mutate(lag = lag(pred),
         dif = pred - lag)
```

---

```{r lag2}
pred_frame2 %>%
  mutate(lag = lag(pred),
         dif = pred - lag,
         dif_per_unit = dif / 10)
```

--

```{r print-coef}
coef(m2)
```


---
### Notice - we kept ell constant

Let's try again, keeping meals constant

```{r pred_frame3}
pred_frame3 <- tibble(meals = 50,
                      ell = seq(0, 25, 5))
head(pred_frame3)
```

---
# Make the predictions

```{r pred_frame3-add-var}
pred_frame3 %>%
  mutate(pred = predict(m2, newdata = pred_frame3))

```

---

```{r lag3}
pred_frame3 %>%
  mutate(pred = predict(m2, newdata = pred_frame3),
         dif = pred - lag(pred),
         dif_per_unit = dif / 5)
```

--
```{r print-coef2}
coef(m2)
```

---
# Lots of scenarios

* First, make a whole bunch of scenarios
  + Note, this is not code I would expect you to be able to replicate, this is
    for instructional purposes only

```{r pred2}
pred_frame4 = tibble(meals = rep(seq(0, 100, 1), 6),
                     ell = rep(seq(0, 25, 5), each = 101))
```

.pull-left[
```{r head-pred4-1}
head(pred_frame4)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r tail-pred4-1}
tail(pred_frame4)
```

]

---
# Make predictions

```{r pred_frame4-add-var}
pred_frame4 <- pred_frame4 %>%
  mutate(pred = predict(m2, newdata = pred_frame4))
```


.pull-left[
```{r head-pred2-2}
head(pred_frame4)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r tail-pred2-2}
tail(pred_frame4)
```

]


---
# Plot predictions

```{r pred-plot, fig.height = 5.75}
ggplot(pred_frame4, aes(meals, pred, color = factor(ell))) +
  geom_line(size = 1.25)
```

--

Notice all the lines are exactly parallel. That's the model we fit! 

---
# Regression plane visualization

[demo]

.gray[(this is also not code you're expected to know)]

```{r 3d-plot, eval = FALSE}
library(rgl)
colors2 <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(2, "Accent")

# Plot 3d scatter
plot3d(x = d$meals, 
       y = d$ell, 
       z = d$api00, 
       col = colors2[1])

# Overlay the regression plane
planes3d(coef(m2)["meals"], 
         coef(m2)["ell"], 
         -1,
         coef(m2)["(Intercept)"], 
         col = colors2[2])
```

# Calculating MR Slopes

.red[
.Large[
$$
b = \frac{\sum\_{xy}}{\sum\_x^2}
$$
]]

--

.Large[
$$
 b\_{y1.2}=\frac{(\sum x\_2^2)(\sum x\_1y)-(\sum x_1x_2)(\sum x_2y)}{
 (\sum x\_1^2)(\sum x\_2^2)-(\sum x\_1x\_2)^2} 
$$
]

### Let's label the parts!

--
Can you predict how $b_{y2.1}$ would be calculated?


---
# Thinking about this more

--

* Basically, we want to evaluate *only* the unique variance between $x_1$ and
$y$, and $x_2$ and $y$

--

  + In other words, we want to **remove shared variance**

--
* We can estimate the multiple regression coefficients with multiple simple
linear regression models


---
# Step 0: Setup the dataframe
* Remove all missing data from the variables we'll use, so we have a consistent
data source

```{r listwise-deleted}
listwise <- d %>% 
  dplyr::select(api00, meals, ell) %>% 
  na.omit()

head(listwise)
```

---
# Step 1
We'll focus on $b_{y1.2}$ first
* Fit a model with $x_1$ predicting $x_2$

--
### Why?

--

```{r shared1}
shared1 <- lm(meals ~ ell, listwise)
display(shared1, detail = TRUE)
```

---
# Step 2
* Extract the residuals from this model
* Store the residuals as a new variable in the data frame

--
### Why?

--

```{r extract-resid1}
listwise <- listwise %>%
  mutate(resid_x1x2 = residuals(shared1))
head(listwise)
```

---
# Step 3
### Final step

Can you predict?

--
* Use the residuals to predict the outcome

```{r model-resid1}
x1x2_mod <- lm(api00 ~ resid_x1x2, listwise)
```

--

```{r coefs}
coef(x1x2_mod)
coef(m2)
```

---
# Example Interpretation
Remember, we must interpret the model as a whole

--

> A one percent increase in the percentage of students in the school receiving 
  free or reduced price meal subsidies corresponded to, on average, a 
  `r -1*round(coef(m2)[2], 2)` point drop in API scores in the year 2000, 
  **while holding the percentage of students receiving English language
  services in the school constant**.

---
# Thinking back to this plot

```{r pred-plot2, fig.height = 5.75, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(pred_frame4, aes(meals, pred, color = factor(ell))) +
  geom_line(size = 1.25)
```

--
* As long as we stay within a constant level for ELL, the slope is the same, 
and the expected change is the same. 

--
* If we vary ELL with meals, the predicted API would be different.

---
# Another visualization
If we can use simple linear regression to get the MR coefficients, then we can *visualize* the MR relations more easily.

```{r pred-res1, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(listwise, aes(resid_x1x2, api00)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

---
# Or on the scale of the predictor

```{r visreg}
library(visreg)
visreg(m2)

```

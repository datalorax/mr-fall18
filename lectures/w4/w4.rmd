# Thinking about learning objectives
I would really like you to leave this class being able to do the following:
1. Read in data to R
1. Produce some basic visualizations of the data
  + Distributions, scatterplots with linear models overlaid, boxplots, barplots

# What questions do you have?

---
# First thing's first
Let's get some data!

[demo]

Please follow along. We'll load the `hsb2.sav` file.

```{r include = FALSE}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(rio)
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 25))
d <- import(here("data", "hsb2.sav"),
            setclass = "tbl_df") %>%
      characterize()
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 25))
```

# Variance of the estimate
Recall the residual standard error 

.Large[
$$
s\_{y.x} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (Y - Y')^2}{df}} =  \sqrt{\frac{ss_{res}}{df}}
$$

$$
df = n - k - 1
$$

]


--
* A quick note on notation
  + When we use `arm::display()` it reports $k$ as the number of estimated
    parameters. (this is pretty standard and actually what I usually use)
  + Pedhazur uses $k$ to indicate the number of *predictors* in the model
  + I'll stick with Pedhazur's even though it's a little unnatural for me.

---
## In the simple linear regression case
* The standard error of $b$ is

.Large[
$$
s\_b = \frac{s\_{y.x}}{\sqrt{\sum x^2}}
$$
]


--
In words... the model residual standard error divided by the (square root of
the) sum of the squared deviations

--
### Quick verification
.gray[Do it with me!]

* First, let's fit a model with students' reading scores predicting their
mathematics scores. 

---

```{r fit-m1, message = FALSE}
m1 <- lm(math ~ read, d)
```

--

```{r display-m1}
arm::display(m1, detail = TRUE)
```

* Let's interpret the results

---
# Confirm

.Large[
$$
s\_b = \frac{s\_{y.x}}{\sqrt{\sum x^2}}
$$
]

--

* We'll focus on calculating the denominator, and we'll just plug-in the
numerator. 

--
* What's the sum of squares again?

---
First, calculate the deviations (note - we're creating a new variable, `dev`,
  then selecting our original `read` variable and `dev` only).

```{r calc-dev}
mean(d$read)
ss <- d %>%
  select(read)

ss %>%
  mutate(dev = read - mean(read)) %>% #<<
  head()
```

---
# Square the deviations

```{r square-dev}
ss %>%
  mutate(dev = read - mean(read),
         dev2 = dev^2) %>% #<<
  head()
```

---
# Sum the squared deviations

```{r sum-squared-dev}
ss %>%
  mutate(dev = read - mean(read),
         dev2 = dev^2,
         sum_squares = sum(dev2)) %>% #<<
  head()
```

---
# Square Root

```{r denom}
ss %>%
  mutate(dev = read - mean(read),
         dev2 = dev^2,
         sum_squares = sum(dev2),
         denom = sqrt(sum_squares)) %>% #<<
  head()
```

---
# SE estimate

```{r se1}
7.04 / 144.6355

arm::display(m1, digits = 4, detail = TRUE)
```

---
# In the MR case
* We have to remove the shared variance

.Large[
$$
s\_{b\_{y1.2}} = \frac{s\_{y.x}}{\sqrt{\sum x\_1^2(1-r\_{x\_1x\_2}^2)}}
$$
]

---
# Quick verification

Let's fit a second model, this time with reading and writing predicting
students' math scores

--

```{r m2-fit}
m2 <- lm(math ~ read + write, d)
arm::display(m2, detail = TRUE, digits = 4)
```

---
```{r verify-se2}
arm::display(m2, digits = 4, detail = TRUE)

# Compute correlation
x1x2_cor <- cor(d$read, d$write)

# Compute sums-of squares for reading (in a single line of code)
ss_read <- sum((d$read - mean(d$read))^2)

6.5553 / sqrt(ss_read*(1 - x1x2_cor^2))
```

---
# Challenge
Can you calculate the standard error for `write` by hand? 

Follow these steps:
1. Compute the correlation, as in the prior slide
2. Compute the sums of squares for `write`
3. Use the code we used before `6.555315 / sqrt(ss_read*(1 - x1x2_cor^2))`,
   but insert your sums of squares estimate.

---
# What is the standard error?

--
The variance of the estimate (standard deviation) over (theoretically) repeated
samples.

# Simulating the process

interested in the code, play with it after class and we can chat if you want.

# Practical takeaways
1. The size of the SE will depend on $n$ because 
$s_{y.x} = \sqrt{\frac{ss_{res}}{df}}$ and $df = n - k - 1$ 

--
1. The size of the SE will depend on the fit to the data because better fit =
smaller $ss_{res}$

--
1. Because `coef/se = t`, larger standard errors will result in smaller $t$
statistics.

--
1. Smaller sample sizes also require larger $t$ to be significant


--
### How do you get a larger $t$

--
Account for more variance (bigger effect size), smaller standard errors, bigger
$n$

---
# Overall model test
* The model $R^2$ represents the proportion the residual variance has been
reduced.

.large[
$$
R^2 = \frac{SS\_{reg}}{SS\_{y}}
$$
]

* Often we want to know if this reduction is significantly different than zero.
  We can evaluate this using an $F$ test.

--

Using $R^2$
.large[
$$
F = \frac{R^2/k}{(1-R^2)/(n - k - 1)}

or using the sums of squares

F = \frac{SS\_{reg}/df\_{reg}}{SS\_{res}/df\_{res}}

# How do we interpret these?

If your model is correct, the interval will contain the true population value
95% of the time.

--

### Not probability-based
* Frequentist stats (which this is) assumes a single "true" population value.
* Our CI comes from the estimated sampling distribution for the point estimate.
* Probability of the "true" value lying within those bounds is 0/1
* Thus, literally, "confidence" based - the wider the interval, the more
confident we can be. 

---
# p values
* A very similar process can be used to estimate the exact p value 


--
### What does a p-value represent?

> the probability of obtaining data as extreme, or more extreme, than those 
  observed if the null hypothesis is correct and the model assumptions are met.



--
* If the value is outside the alpha level, it is "significant"
  + i.e., we can claim that the observed result is unlikely due to random
    sampling variability

---
# But
* The prior slide holds **only if we meet our model-assumptions**
  + If you don't meet your model assumptions, this is usually what gets messed
    up first.

---
# Before we move on
* This discussion is fairly technical and meant as background
  + e.g., "Where do these numbers actually come from?"

--
* Practically, you should be able to
  + Find and interpret SEs
  + Estimate and interpret CIs
  + Correctly interpret *p* values


--
### Let's practice

---
# Fit the corresponding model
$$
read_i = b_0 + b_1(SES_i) + b_2(math_i) + e
$$

Discuss at your table:
* What do the coefficients represent
* What does the standard error for math represent?
* What does the standard error for the SES-low represent?
* Interpret the p-values for the SES coefficients
* Estimate and interpret the 95% CIs for the model

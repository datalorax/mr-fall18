# Content Knowledge

1. Name and describe what each of the following figures are showing.

![](img/partial.png)
![](img/zero-order.png)
![](img/semipartial.png)

<font color = "#3BAADE">

* The first diagram  shows a partial correlation squared, also known as 
partial $\eta^2$. It shows the relation between X1 and Y, with both variables 
residualized with respect to X2.

* The second diagram shows the zero-order correlation between X1 and Y, 
squared. This is the variance accounted for in Y without including any other
variables.

* The third diagram shows the squared semi-partial correlation between X1 and Y. 
It shows the relation between X1 and Y, with X1 residualized with respect to X2.

2. Briefly (1-2 sentences) describe the difference between partial and 
semi-partial correlations.

<font color = "#3BAADE">

Partial correlations are the unique relation between a variable and the 
residualized outcome, while semi-partial correlations are the unique relation
between a variable and the outcome. In other words, for both correlations the 
X variable is residualized with respect to all other variables in the model, but
for partial correlations the outcome is also residualized.

3. Briefly (3 sentences max) describe which type of correlation is generally
more useful, and why.

<font color = "#3BAADE">

Semi-Partial correlations are generally more useful because the denominator is
always the same, making them all directly comparable. Further, if the values
are squared, they are on the same scale as the model $R^2$ and can be 
interpreted as the unique variance accounted for by the predictor variable,
controlling for all other variables in the model.

# Applied Practice

1. Use the code chunk below to import the "depression.xlsx" dataset

```{r diagnostic-practice, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rio)
library(here)
theme_set(theme_minimal())

d <- import(here("data", "depression.xlsx"),
            setclass = "tbl_df") 
```

In the code chunk below, fit a model that addersses the following research 
questions.

> RQ1: What is the effect of income and physical health on depression, 
controlling for age and marital status?

In the data, `depression_score` indicates the overall depressive symptoms the
individual is exhibiting, with higher values indicating greater depression. 
Because health and marital status are categorical, they will need to have a 
reference group defined. Define these variables such that the reference group 
represents individuals who were married and in poor health. Note that after 
fitting the model you will still need to interpret the intercept relative to
**all** variables in the model

```{r model}
d <- d %>% 
  mutate(health = factor(health),
         health = relevel(health, ref = "poor"),
         marital  = factor(marital),
         marital  = relevel(marital, ref = "married"))
m <- lm(depression_score ~ health + income + age + marital, d)
summary(m)
```

2. Calculate squared semi-partial correlations for the model in the code chunk
below.

```{r ssr}
library(lmSupport)
modelEffectSizes(m)
```

Interpret the squared semi-partial correlations below. 

<font color = "#3BAADE">

* Health uniquely accounted for 7.1% of the total variability in depression 
scores.
* Income uniquely accounted for 1.8% of the total variability in depression 
scores.
* Age uniquely accounted for 3.7% of the total variability in depression 
scores.
* Sex uniquely accounted for 0.6% of the total variability in depression 
scores.

</font>

3. Modify the code below to produce a coefficient plot

```{r coefplot}
library(broom)
tidy_pd <- tidy(m, conf.int = TRUE)

ggplot(tidy_pd, aes(term, estimate)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, 
             color = "cornflowerblue",
             size = 2) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, 
                    ymax = conf.high)) +
  coord_flip()
```

4. In a word document provide a table of the model, and a brief interpretation
of the findings. Write as if you were writing the results up for publication.
Include confidence intervals in your table and reference the squared semipartial
correlations in text.
